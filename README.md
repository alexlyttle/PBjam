# PBjam
A repo for our peak baggin code and tips on jam

The rds directory for data storage (spectra or otherwise) is /rds/projects/n/nielsemb-plato-peakbagging/pbjam. Read/write permission for everyone has been requested. It should have 2TB free disk space, and if we need more Martin can request it.
