# PBjam
A repo for our peak baggin code and tips on jam

The rds directory for data storage (spectra or otherwise) is /rds/projects/n/nielsemb-plato-peakbagging/pbjam. Read/write permission should now have been granted to Guy, Oli and Ted. It should have 2TB free disk space, and if we need more Martin can request it.

To mount the directory on your local machine do: 
$ sudo mount -t cifs -o vers=3.0 -o domain=ADF -o username=USERNAME -o uid=USERNAME -o gid=USERNAME //its-rds.bham.ac.uk/rdsprojects/n/nielsemb-plato-peakbagging /my/local/directory
