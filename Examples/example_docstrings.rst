An Example Docstring
####################

Docstrings are readable text associated with a function or unit of code that describes what it does, what inputs it takes and what outputs it provides. For PBjam we try to follow the Numpy format for docstring, which you can read about `here <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_. 


The following is a simple example of a function that includes a docstring:

.. code-block:: python
  def my_function(a, b=1):
      c = a + b

      return c

Text continues
